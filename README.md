# Program intended use

![Screeshot of the site on flowchat](./assets/images/flowchart.jpg)

The Python program developed is designed to gather valuable feedback from employees.

The program begins by asking employees to input their department, and then asks them five questions that require a rating between 1 and 5. Once employees have submitted their responses, the program automatically pushes the information to a Google Sheet, where the responses are compiled and averaged per department on a separate sheet.

This updated average is sent back to the terminal, to give employees an up to date rating per department before the deadline is finished and the results will be announced.
